**IntelliJ IDEA shortcuts ([IntelliJIDEA_ReferenceCard](https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/intellij-idea/docs/IntelliJIDEA_ReferenceCard.pdf))**

## Learn shortcuts as you work
IntelliJ IDEA provides several possibilities to learn shortcuts:

Find Action lets you search for commands and settings across all menus and tools.

Press `Ctrl+Shift+A` and start typing to get a list of suggested actions. Then select the necessary action and press `Enter` to execute it.

Find Action
To add or change the shortcut for any action, press `Alt+Enter` when it is selected in the list.


If you are using one of the predefined keymaps, you can print the default keymap reference card  and keep it on your desk to consult it if necessary. This cheat sheet is also available under Help | Keyboard Shortcuts PDF.


The following table lists some of the most useful shortcuts to learn:
